Welcome to the *Becoming-DevOps Advanced Learning Path* by ISCP Container Platform. :fire: 

== New client! 

*ISCP has recently won a new Deal with an Important Shop in Amsterdam. This client has an important Web Application deployed in their On-Premise cluster and wants to migrate it to the Cloud.*

The client has required us to deploy an *entire environment to supply their developers with enough tools for monitoring, log management, continuous deployment and access via the Internet to all microservices*. 

With these requirements, our Architect has created some tasks in Jira Software according to the following information.

= Client Application
The client wants to deploy an application which contains a Frontend (proxy), Backend and some microservices to integrate the application. It is not important which containers are used by the applications but the following customer requirements:

 * Have the *index patterns in the Elasticsearch* (one per day, persistence and rotation logs per week). 
 * *Monitor all applications* by namespace occupation, CPU Usage, Memory Usage and Network consumes. 
 * Have access to the application through the following ingress URL 
 ** `*http(s)://shop-socks:<port>*`
 * Have access to the Dashboard through the following access: 
 ** `*http(s)://shop-socks-[kibana|elasticsearch|prometheus|grafana|jenkins]*`

After the deadline, the the DevOps team *should do a Demo to the ISCP Spain Team (as though it was a client) to explain the functionalities, deployments, tasks, problems and functions from this project.* 

The ISCP team could ask any questions about monitoring, logging, CI/CD, Kubernetes to know everything about the architecture, infrastructure and development of the solution. 

* Duration 30-45 minutes
